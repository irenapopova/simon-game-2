# Simon Game- Advanced Front End Development Project

Implemented the classic 1980s Simon Game. A user can start the game and play until the user gets a series of 20 steps correct.
Then then game will start again. The user has the ability to play in Strict Mode, which will restart the game to a single step if the user presses a wrong button.
Built using vanillaJS, HTML5, and CSS3.

## Challenge Details

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* User Story: I am presented with a random series of button presses.

* User Story: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

* User Story: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

* User Story: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

* User Story: I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

* User Story: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

* User Story: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
